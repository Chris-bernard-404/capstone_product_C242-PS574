# HealthAlert

HealthAlert is an Android-based mobile application designed for individuals who are too busy to visit a doctor for routine health check-ups. By leveraging smartphone camera-based PPG (Photoplethysmography) technology, the app provides a quick assessment of whether the user is at potential risk for heart disease.
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is critical for effective prevention and treatment. However, many working professionals lack the time for regular check-ups, which can delay the identification of potential risks. HealthAlert bridges this gap by providing a convenient tool for heart health monitoring, empowering users to take preventive steps promptly.
Our team is committed to creating an accessible, technology-driven solution that enables busy individuals to prioritize their health without disrupting their schedules, promoting awareness and early intervention in managing heart disease risks.
